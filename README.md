This project is a basic external cheat for [AssaultCube](https://assault.cubers.net/), a cross-platform open source 2008 FPS.

## Description
I made this project as an introduction on memory manipulation and binary hacking. Understanding how memory works and can be compromised is key to better code practices.<br>

### Why AssaultCube
AssaultCube is a cross-platform lightweight multiplayer open-source FPS, making it one of the most famous playground for beginner-level binary hacking.
